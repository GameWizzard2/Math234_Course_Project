NetworkX Graph Visualization
Overview
This project demonstrates how to create and visualize different types of graphs using the NetworkX library in Python. It includes functions to create undirected and directed graphs and the ability to view each graph visually using interactive matplotlib features.

Features
Graph 1: An undirected graph with custom nodes and edges.
Graph 2: An original graph and its subgraph, demonstrating node subsets.
Graph 3: Conversion of an undirected graph to a directed graph, with added nodes and edges.

Requirements
Python 3.x
networkx library
matplotlib library
